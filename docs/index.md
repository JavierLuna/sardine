# Sardine

Welcome to Sardine's documentation!

Sardine is a tool to download and use docker-compose stacks.

If you usually use dockerized databases instead of installing them, 
or have several aliases with `docker run` commands inside, this is your tool!

Sardine is simple to use and attempts to be configurable and easy to track on a repository.
