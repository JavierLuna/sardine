# Requirements

Sardine needs the following programs and libraries installed and configured:

* `git` - [Link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
* `docker` - [Link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
* `docker-compose` - [Link](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* `python 3.6+` - [Link](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Sardine will expect your `docker-compose` binary to be on the `PATH`. 
If not, you can configure its location via the env variable `SARDINE_DOCKER_COMPOSE_EXECUTABLE_PATH`.
