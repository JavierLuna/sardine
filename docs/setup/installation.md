# Installation

Sardine is a CLI tool written in Python 3.6+, and it is hosted in [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/sardine/).

## Pip
As such, you can use `pip` to install it:

```bash
pip install sardine --user
```

## Pipx (recommended)
A much better solution would be to use [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) to install it, 
to keep the tool isolated and your Python installation clean!

```bash
pipx install sardine
```


## Check if installation was correct
You can check that sardine is properly installed by doing:

```bash
sardine -h
```
