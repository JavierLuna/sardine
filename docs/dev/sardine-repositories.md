# Sardine repositories

One of the neatest things that sardine offers is the possibility of having your stacks up in [Github](https://github.com).

For sardine to recognize your repository, it must follow a simple structure:

```
.
|-- stack-name
|   |
|   `-- docker-compose.yml
`-- stack-name-2
    |
    `-- docker-compose.yml
```

Notice that you can still put other files, but as long as you follow that directory/file structure you'll be good.
